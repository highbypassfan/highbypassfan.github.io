wow this is actually pretty easy

Initially I used AI to get the framework, but have since just edited directly after learning how each part works. Which I think is a good balance of moving quickly and learning (since I have a direct example to use vs trying to learn new concepts with no context). My goal here is to make a good repository of information, both to be useful to other people and also to demonstrate things I've done to increase my luck cross section.
